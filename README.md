# Zomato Bangalore Restaurants Analysis

## Introduction

This project delves into the Zomato Bangalore Restaurants dataset to extract meaningful insights about dining preferences, online order availability, table booking facilities, restaurant ratings, and popular cuisines. The aim is to understand the current trends in the food industry of Bangalore and provide data-driven recommendations for restaurant owners and food enthusiasts.

## Analysis Overview

### Data Preparation

The dataset is first prepared by loading it into a data frame, followed by dropping unnecessary columns that are not relevant to the analysis. This step helps in simplifying the dataset for easier manipulation and analysis.

### Data Cleaning

The cleaning process involves handling missing values, removing duplicates, and standardizing the format of certain columns like restaurant ratings. This ensures the quality and reliability of the dataset for accurate analysis.

### Feature Engineering

Key features such as restaurant type and cuisines are refined by grouping less frequent categories under a common label 'others'. This simplification aids in a clearer analysis of the most prevalent restaurant types and cuisines in Bangalore.

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Through EDA, the dataset is explored to uncover patterns and relationships between different variables. Visualizations play a crucial role in this stage, offering insights into the distribution of restaurants across locations, the popularity of online ordering and table booking services, and the average ratings of restaurants.

### Insights and Recommendations

The analysis concludes with a set of insights and recommendations derived from the data. These might include strategies for restaurant owners to enhance customer satisfaction, understanding the impact of online services on restaurant ratings, and identifying popular cuisines and dining preferences among Bangaloreans.

### Conclusion

The project encapsulates the dining landscape of Bangalore through a detailed examination of the Zomato dataset. By leveraging data analytics and visualization techniques, it provides a comprehensive overview of consumer preferences and operational aspects of restaurants, paving the way for informed decision-making in the culinary business domain.
